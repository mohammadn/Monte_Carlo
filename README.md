# Monte_Carlo
Monte_Carlo simulation on Cloud

I used Flask to build the web app and Google App Engine for hosting it. The app functionality is calculating a Monte Carlo Math formula based on user inputs. However, for calculation, it uses two different services, one Lambda and another one EC2. The most important option of the app is estimating the fee of using each of the services above to illuminate which service is more cost-effective to use.
